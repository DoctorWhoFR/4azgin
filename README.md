Welcome to my GitHub profile, my name is Maxime but you can call me Dr.azgin. 
I'm a programmer who likes to make computer programs, algorithms and also websites and logical backends, including API programming.

I also have many projects in cloud structures, powered by linode and aws.
I am also a first user of Amazon WebService and also GoogleCloud and FireBase.

I'm a big fan of a mobile web application called NodeJS Native Application coded in JS NodeJS. 
I love the fact that NodeJS is an international language and you can see it with my web and mobile applications.

I'm an independent R&D user, which is great, I love my computer skills and I've also taken steps to improve myself.          
I am very open about my work, I often post updates in the comments and also on LinkedIn.         

I am open to suggestions for new projects to start.
